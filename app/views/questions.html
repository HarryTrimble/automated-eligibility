        Questions and thoughts raised by making the prototypes
      </h1>

      <p class="govuk-body">We believe a good early prototype should raise more questions than it answers. Meaning for us a early prototype is a question machine.</p>

      <p class="govuk-body">Questions and thoughts raised by making the prototypes:</p>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">GOV.UK Proof</h2>

      <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Value proposition</h3>

      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>Do you need two separate propositions for orgs with data and ones who need it to provide services?</li>
        <li>Are the main points of proof already covered - or is there a long tail?</li>
        <li>Could secure file transfer be its own product? Could we show the HMRC team whoâ€™s <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/hmrc-secure-data-exchange-service-sdes">built one</a>?</li>
        <li>How do we allow the level of data shown [in a proof] to be configured based on service needs / data protection?</li>
        <li>What are the level of needs for each of these [sending proof by email and post]?</li>
        <li>If services want to send proof via post, how much benefit does this service offer?</li>
        <li>Is there a need for services to check proofs in bulk?</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Sign up and onboarding</h3>

      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>Do we need to have any more thoughts about onboarding like we did with life events? Carly Gilson</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Security and privacy</h3>

      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>How long should data be retained?</li>
        <li>Data retention, how long and can we delete early if consumed?</li>
        <li>Do we want to allow proofs to be revoked?</li>
        <li>How much data needs to be shown <a href="#">here</a>? And is it quite specific to each service?</li>
        <li>Do we need security around <a href="#">this web address</a>?</li>
        <li>Should checker have to provide more info about the person as well as proof ID to access the proof?</li>
      </ul>

      Proof as QR codes

      Is there a privacy risk of having too much information in QR code? Darwin Peltan
      What are the scenarios where a QR would be used? Darwin Peltan
      What should be in the QR code? Oskar Williams
      How much can we cram in a QR code? Ethan Mills
      How secure should the QR code be, what level of trust? Oskar Williams
      What's an appropriate signature scheme? Ethan Mills

      Authentication

      How much data should be viewable in a proof without authentication? Harry Trimble
      Who [user, data holder, services checking] should authentication sit with? Harry Trimble
      What level of auth will we need [as a service checking a proof? Oskar Williams
      Who should be allowed to check proofs? Harry Trimble

      Other user journeys

      What would adding a proof to somewhere else look like? Harry Trimble
      How would the user provide their proof in an online application journey? Darwin Peltan

      Technical constraints
      What are tech-informed view on barriers to being able to consume proof? Stephen Gill
      How do we enable automation of data exchange for organisations that can't take advantage of APIs? Harry Trimble
      How might we enable more technical orgs to check a proof automatically e.g. via an API? Darwin Peltan
      Legality and contracts
      How would we enable this legally? I.e. this makes it sound simple but would data sharing agreements would be required for each new instance? Or would it be consent led by citizens? Fay Beverton

      GOV.UK Life Events
      Value proposition
      What are the cross-overs with the 'Tell Gov Once' platform idea? Fay Beverton
      What "life events" should be prioritised? Most value to the three different user groups? Harry Trimble
      How often are there significant enough cross-overs in eligibility criteria? Ethan Mills
      Can we create template data sharing agreements? Carly Gilson
      How much should creating data sharing agreements be part of the GDX platform, product, business model? Harry Trimble
      This whole journey is a simplified version of CDDO's Design a Data Share work. They have rich research into what the needs are here and it's more complicated - we would need to link up with
      this. Fay Beverton
      What are the high level needs for a sub-pub platform? We have them for GOV.UK Proof concept. How much data should be viewable in a proof without authentification? Harry Trimble
      Technical constraints
      What are the Tech-informed view on barriers to being able to consume life events? Stephen Gill
      To what extent can LAs make use of this information? Automatically? Ethan Mills
      Legality and contracts
      There's probably a way to frame this that's less problematic from a legal point of view - (1) sign in to view events you're already allowed to sub to; then (2) request the creation of a new DSA
      to allow access to a new sub Stephen Gill
      What are the laws around the sharing of medical data? Fay Beverton
      Notifications
      Who would be sending this out? DWP or the local authority? Fay Beverton
      What level of detail do local authorities need here? Fay Beverton
      Consent and transparency
      What services need there own separate platform to record consent? Harry Trimble
      Might need to let user choose which services / teams to share with in LA? Darwin Peltan
      What auditing is needed? Harry Trimble
      Routing to right organisation
      How accurately can we determine the local authority that the citizen is in? Fay Beverton
      Would we need to share with more than one LA? Darwin Peltan
      Admin settings
      How to deal with multiple teams / systems in a LA needing this data? Darwin Peltan
      Alternative journeys
      What would the journey look like if someone applied for school transport who was already receiving DLA (e.g ask someone to consent to council asking DWP for their data as part of the application
      journey)
